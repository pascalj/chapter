#Chapter#

Chapter is a simple gem to set mp4 chapter information.

## Prerequisites

To use it, you'll need [mp4v2][1] installed on your system.

On OS X:

    brew install mp4v2

On FreeBSD:

    cd /usr/ports/multimedia/mp4v2 && make install clean
    
On other systems you might need to compile it yourself. Please refer to the mp4v2 [documentation][2] on how to do that.
##Installation##
Via Rubygems:

    gem install chapter
Or add the gem to your `Gemfile`:

    gem 'chapter'

## Usage

### Read the chapters of a file

```ruby
require 'chapter'
chapters = MP4v2::Chapter.chapters('/path/to/file.m4a')
```
    
`chapters` will be an array of hashes. Each hash represents a chapter with its position and duration (both in microseconds) and its title.
####Example

```ruby
[
  {"title"=>"Introduction", "duration"=>12325, "position"=>0},
  {"title"=>"Discussion", "duration"=>655325, "position"=>12325}
]
```
    
### Write chapters
Setting the chapters is just as simple:

```ruby
require 'chapter'
chapters = [
    {"title"=>"Introduction", "duration"=>12325},
    {"title"=>"Discussion", "duration"=>655325}
]
MP4v2::Chapter.set_chapters("/path/fo/file.m4a", chapters)
```
**CAUTION**: `set_chapters` will overwrite any existing chapters in the file.
